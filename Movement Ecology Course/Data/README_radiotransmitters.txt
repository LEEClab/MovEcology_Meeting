Data Attributes
These definitions come from the Movebank Attribute Dictionary, available at www.movebank.org/node/2381.

animal ID: An individual identifier for the animal, provided by the data owner. This identifier can be a ring number, a name, the same as the associated tag ID, etc. If the data owner does not provide an Animal ID, an internal Movebank animal identifier may sometimes be shown.
	example: 91876A, Gary
	same as: individual-local-identifier

attachment type: The way a tag is attached to an animal. Values are chosen from a controlled list:
	collar: The tag is attached by a collar around the animal's neck.
	glue: The tag is attached to the animal using glue.

	implant: The tag is placed under the skin of the an animal.
	tape: The tag is attached to the animal using tape.
	other: user specified

deploy off timestamp: The timestamp when the tag deployment ended.

	format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.sss
	units: UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) or GPS time, which is a few leap seconds different from UTC
	same as: deploy off date
THIS DATASET: Values are not provided for all deployments.

	same as: deploy on date
THIS DATASET: Values are not provided for all deployments.

event comments: Additional information about individual records or events in a data set that is not described by other reference data terms.
	example: we observed the animal foraging (see photo BT25)
	same as: comments

event ID: An identifier for the set of information associated with each record or event in a data set. A unique event ID is assigned to every time-location or other time-measurement record in Movebank.
	example: 6340565
	units: none

GPS fix type: The type of GPS fix. 1 = no fix; 2 = 2D fix (altitude typically not valid); 3 = 3D fix (altitude typically valid).

	units: none

GPS satellite count: The number of GPS satellites used to estimate the location.
	example: 8
	units: none

height above mean sea level: The estimated height of the tag above mean sea level returned by the GPS unit. (If altitudes are calculated as height above an ellipsoid, use height above ellipsoid.)
	example: 34
	units: meters
	same as: height above msl

latitude (decimal degree): The geographic longitude of a location along an animal track as estimated by the processed sensor data. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it.

taxon: The scientific name of the species on which the tag was deployed, as defined by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS, www.itis.gov).
